# Face-Recognition-Using-PCA
Implementation of PCA in Python for recognizing Faces:
1. Single Person Image
2. Group Image
3. Recognize Face In Video
# Requirements
1. numpy
2. opencv
3. scipy
# Usage

for single image = 0
for video = 1
for group image = 2
2. The project uses ORL dataset, You can put your dataset in the images folder and change the name of the dataset in the dataset.py file
3. Enjoy Project
